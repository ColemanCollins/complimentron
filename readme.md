#Complimentron
###A robot that says nice things about you


This is the repo that contains the software that makes complimentron run. It's on my get-it-done-by-summer-2016 list of things to write a detailed post that explains what to do with this (that is, how to put it on a raspberry pi, what the associated circuit and breadboard look like, printer recommendations, etc).


You can see complimentron make compliments from the list into your terminal by running `npm install` and then `node preview.js`
